    "These are one of `pEYES`'s data structures, and they contain many useful attributes and methods that are easier to use than manipulating the raw data directly. For example, we can use an `Event` object to calculate the duration of the event, instead of manually calculating the difference between the start and end times of the samples that compose the event.  \n",
